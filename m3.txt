Human: I'm writing again <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929> I do like this story I'm trying to make
Human: Can't wait for the infinite arc
Human: Was funny asf though
Human: Ted's goal was to send a message and he was very intelligent, but his morals weren't very grounded and he was willing to do whatever it took to achieve them. I think the difference is, while the two are somewhat related, is that he decided to focus it on one evil individual and wasn't targeting many, since Ted was mail bombing civillians.
Human: Didnt know google's api was free
Human: ha
Human: Esto es un robo
Human: Was an extremely intelligent man, but his willingness to mass murder and stuff just overshadowed his message and goals
Human: yes
Human: Esto es un robo
Human: https://tenor.com/view/okay-mark-hoffman-saw6-fine-alright-gif-21986615
Human: You could argue that he's just doing his job as well, but insurance companies are inherently evil so it's hard to sympathize with him more than you should.
Human: probably
Human: <:Salute:1267690556109226097>
Human: people or
Human: Life Insurance profits off the death of people which is a shitty business in of itself. He had it coming.
Human: Then again it was probably just a test by john and he didnt respect her that much to begin with anyway. Probably knew something like that would happen
Human: That ending was kinda shit ngl <:weird:885622768052338708> she broke the rules and didn't follow his wishes and the story was wack anyway
Human: They went as far as to find his killer, but he's taken many more lives I'm sure
Human: They only made it a big deal because the media tried to push it out, and now you have people trying to argue morals because of how many he sentenced to death by letting his auto rejection program ran. It's very interesting
Human: I would even go as far to call him a hero but the ceo is just going to get replaced by someone doing the same shit, as is the cycle
Human: mhm
Human: Does political stance matter when a retard killed like that goes beyond political struggle <:reinhardtSmile:630021538577514496> 
Very glad he's gone
Human: Should of just said "woops we cant find him" <:keks:824495061899018280>

Human: I havent been there in quite awhile
Human: If It's a good movie then the extra runtime won't hurt it unless it drags on and brings down the actual good scenes, so it's gonna depend on what they pad the movie with
Human: I walked out on the blade runner opening night because it's boring as fuck
Human: If they're good I don't mind but if they drag on I walk out
Human: I dont like them that much
Human: He likes longer movies and adding everything possible but the studios like to force him to cut it down
Human: What?
Human: Apparently there's an alternative cut with more content but they won't let them release it just yet
Human: I think
Human: Oh wait he did suicide squad
Human: Thats what hes mostly known for yeah
Human: Gunn was the marvel guy
Human: That was Snyder
Human: He hasnt really done anything yet <:weird:885622768052338708>

Human: Freaky Kami arc
Human: The ironic part is I had her sister calling me blaming me for her going to soul sleep (jws hell) and not entering heaven and a bunch of other shit like me causing her death 
What a wack job
Human: How come?
Human: A lot of them didn't celebrate it by my mom and dad without telling the faith because they weren't as devout. One day my mom's sister found out and got her shunned too right before her death
Human: As sad as that is
Human: I only did when I was with the family that celebrated it but most of them disowned me or are dead
Human: I just don't see the point I guess
Human: Not anymore since I lived alone but I've been thinking about it
Human: I still have some for decoration or sitting on
Human: I did that too when my collection was a lot larger just to get back what I paid for and there was little room left haha
Human: Fair enough
Human: Or $300-$350
Human: Think she goes for like $350-$400
Human: For hm?
Human: What you sell
Human: Congrats
Human: Just say "I watched hentai with nux" leave the redditors seething and keep your audience
Human: Whole thing was just blown out of proportion <:dsppepweird:1174311575021162506>
Human: So dxd
Human: It's just high schoolers drawn like teenagers with huge booba
Human: Nah
Human: Mutahar is just insecure
Human: It's just generic hentai slop with no "children" so it wasn't even loli
Human: Not really
Human: 3/10
Human: I did research after watching
Human: It's just busty and petite hentai bitches
Human: Nee Summer isn't even loli
Human: And they're not people
Human: You watched porn? Cool! Only the redditors were upset by it
Human: Threw his friend under the bus and tried to make a poor excuse for something blown out of proportion
Human: It blew up so he had no choice but to respond
It was probably better as a post
