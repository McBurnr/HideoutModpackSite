McBurn: His cape is white and so is most of the top so I don't think it would work. That's just my opinion
I would ask your artist over me though

McBurn: I'm writing again <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929> I do like this story I'm trying to make
McBurn: Can't wait for the infinite arc
McBurn: Was funny asf though
McBurn: Ted's goal was to send a message and he was very intelligent, but his morals weren't very grounded and he was willing to do whatever it took to achieve them. I think the difference is, while the two are somewhat related, is that he decided to focus it on one evil individual and wasn't targeting many, since Ted was mail bombing civillians.
McBurn: Didnt know google's api was free
McBurn: ha
McBurn: Esto es un robo
McBurn: Was an extremely intelligent man, but his willingness to mass murder and stuff just overshadowed his message and goals
McBurn: yes
McBurn: Esto es un robo
McBurn: https://tenor.com/view/okay-mark-hoffman-saw6-fine-alright-gif-21986615
McBurn: You could argue that he's just doing his job as well, but insurance companies are inherently evil so it's hard to sympathize with him more than you should.
McBurn: probably
McBurn: <:Salute:1267690556109226097>
McBurn: people or
McBurn: Life Insurance profits off the death of people which is a shitty business in of itself. He had it coming.
McBurn: Then again it was probably just a test by john and he didnt respect her that much to begin with anyway. Probably knew something like that would happen
McBurn: That ending was kinda shit ngl <:weird:885622768052338708> she broke the rules and didn't follow his wishes and the story was wack anyway
McBurn: They went as far as to find his killer, but he's taken many more lives I'm sure
McBurn: They only made it a big deal because the media tried to push it out, and now you have people trying to argue morals because of how many he sentenced to death by letting his auto rejection program ran. It's very interesting
McBurn: I would even go as far to call him a hero but the ceo is just going to get replaced by someone doing the same shit, as is the cycle
McBurn: mhm
McBurn: Does political stance matter when a retard killed like that goes beyond political struggle <:reinhardtSmile:630021538577514496> 
Very glad he's gone
McBurn: Should of just said "woops we cant find him" <:keks:824495061899018280>

McBurn: I havent been there in quite awhile
McBurn: If It's a good movie then the extra runtime won't hurt it unless it drags on and brings down the actual good scenes, so it's gonna depend on what they pad the movie with
McBurn: I walked out on the blade runner opening night because it's boring as fuck
McBurn: If they're good I don't mind but if they drag on I walk out
McBurn: I dont like them that much
McBurn: He likes longer movies and adding everything possible but the studios like to force him to cut it down
McBurn: What?
McBurn: Apparently there's an alternative cut with more content but they won't let them release it just yet
McBurn: I think
McBurn: Oh wait he did suicide squad
McBurn: Thats what hes mostly known for yeah

McBurn: Freaky Kami arc
McBurn: The ironic part is I had her sister calling me blaming me for her going to soul sleep (jws hell) and not entering heaven and a bunch of other shit like me causing her death 
What a wack job
McBurn: How come?
McBurn: A lot of them didn't celebrate it by my mom and dad without telling the faith because they weren't as devout. One day my mom's sister found out and got her shunned too right before her death
McBurn: As sad as that is
McBurn: I only did when I was with the family that celebrated it but most of them disowned me or are dead
McBurn: I just don't see the point I guess
McBurn: Not anymore since I lived alone but I've been thinking about it
McBurn: I still have some for decoration or sitting on
McBurn: I did that too when my collection was a lot larger just to get back what I paid for and there was little room left haha
McBurn: Fair enough
McBurn: Or $300-$350
McBurn: Think she goes for like $350-$400
McBurn: For hm?
McBurn: What you sell
McBurn: Congrats
McBurn: Just say "I watched hentai with nux" leave the redditors seething and keep your audience
McBurn: Whole thing was just blown out of proportion <:dsppepweird:1174311575021162506>
McBurn: So dxd
McBurn: It's just high schoolers drawn like teenagers with huge booba
McBurn: Nah
McBurn: Mutahar is just insecure
McBurn: It's just generic hentai slop with no "children" so it wasn't even loli
McBurn: Not really
McBurn: 3/10
McBurn: I did research after watching
McBurn: It's just busty and petite hentai bitches
McBurn: Nee Summer isn't even loli
McBurn: And they're not people
McBurn: You watched porn? Cool! Only the redditors were upset by it
McBurn: Threw his friend under the bus and tried to make a poor excuse for something blown out of proportion
McBurn: It blew up so he had no choice but to respond
It was probably better as a post
