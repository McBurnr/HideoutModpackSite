Human: And hypercritical
Human: Ok that was aggressive too
Human: I think you just come off as lacking emotional intelligence so you aren't able to receive or take things at times and end up upsetting others due to it. But there's no changing that, and we tolerate you anyway <:Salute:1267690556109226097>

Human: Him after
Human: I'm used to series having shit character progression and interaction so It was nice to see there be something, even if it could be better
Human: It was alright
Human: I got like 4 bedroom spaces, some downstairs space, and like 2300sq? but the area is kinda....yeah
Human: Aight did the math
Human: I think rent is like $1300-$1700 standard so I could do like $1000-$1100 but depending on how I do the house I might be able to push for more
Cuz I got a lot of like specific shit put into the house
Human: House prices are kinda fucked here so I could get some decent rent out of it
Human: pmuch yeah, true true
Human: Esp if I'm gonna be in a new place
Human: Extra income and stuff
Human: Thankfully I got some nice security around the house so It shouldn't? be that bad, but I wouldn't just sell it no
Human: It's either I'm close to or it's mostly paid off for the mortage so Instead of selling I'd just rent it out or smth, but maintenance would be a bitch and I'd be afraid of squatters
Human: It's alright
Human: It's just miserable here
Human: It's why I wanna travel before settling down
Human: Damn good question my friend
Human: It sucks here
Human: Thankfully she wants to leave too
Human: Sad to say that my gf wont be enough to tie me down cuz I really dont wanna be here
Human: I wanna get out of here
Human: I've been saving a lot
Human: It'll change some dayu
Human: I do unfort <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
Human: Really nice
Human: I would get bored and snack, or do it to feel something, cuz my depression would fuck me or I would keep repeating the same shit and It would get to me

The change has been like
Human: Just treating food like fuel rn cuz I was really bad about shit
Human: yk
Human: One life, make the best of it, don't make shit out of it
Human: Food was like an emotional addiction instability so It kept fucking me up
But now I wanna travel more, go out, see the world, and stop mistreating my body
Human: Remolding yourself into something better perhaps
Human: It's a good mentality
Human: Basically semi-fasting which was dumb
Human: I made that mistake before and did it again
Human: Idk why
Human: <:weird:885622768052338708>
Human: Basically started myself before
Human: I changed my diet and I've been willing to do more shit
Human: I'm just going through my backlog so I'll get there some day
Human: I just said it's back
Human: No <a:WeirdCoffee:458118619130232863>

Human: Does it have more?
Human: Read a few and stopped after it didn't update for like a year or smth
Human: Well see about that
Human: <@524925467216838659> this guy
Human: Your new friend

Human: <:dsprock:1174311303515475968>

Human: Yeah I wasn't a fan 
Mostly because I can't sexualize them without coming off as a pdf
Human: No story is perfect. As long as they don't rush shit it'll be fine
Human: Sorry 
Didn't see right away

Human: This fag doesnt like chuuya as a favorite <@496597770145234944>
Human: Is it Chuuya
Human: Boo! A Madea Halloween
Human: you who
Human: ok general
Human: based on his irl writer's first wife
Human: That's why he said that <:weird:885622768052338708>
Human: His ideal woman is probably sasaki anyway
Human: ok pdf <:weird:885622768052338708>

Human: https://tenor.com/view/fyodor-dostoevsky-bsd-bungo-stray-dogs-fyodor-dostoy-gif-14062091533137682542
Human: Oshit no ko ending tl;dr
Human: Time to break the habit
Human: Not that's just what you usually do
Human: .
Human: Exactly
Human: His mythos is the outer gods so he can't die conventionally
Human: That thing scares me
Human: Isn't that you early judging again
Human: Mangasee has it
Human: I gave one for frieren before that might have the official
Human: try changing it
Human: might be your source too
Human: Can you catch up with the manga and if you like it enough try the anime?
Human: The music compliments every scene the pacing is better the expressions complete the characters and moments and the manga doesn't really do as good of a job as it should with actually piecing together the story and the anime is one of the only exceptions where people recommend it over the manga
Human: Plenty
Human: Sure but you're still reading it and that requires a reasonable amount of attention
Human: See this is why I didn't recommend it cuz he'd say no anyway <:dsppepweird:1174311575021162506> <@1043577025459408926>
Human: js
Human: Also the anime is worth watching
Human: The anime treats it like one too
Human: It's a special
Human: Are you
Human: It's all references to writers and famous figures
Human: hopefully caught up more by then
Human: Open <t:1731713220:R>

Human: <:dsppepweird:1174311575021162506>

Human: Maybe one day
Human: Oshi no ko added to worst endings list <@447915149106479104>
Human: That angel design is kinda dope
Human: I don't think the anime skipped things or changed much and it's got a really nice ost
Human: Both are really good actually
Human: OPM/Black Clover parody but goes kinda hard ngl
Human: The anime not really, the manga has a good amount of chapters
Human: Some are really good, western ones not any better tbh
Human: I read that before the anime came out tho
Human: Mashle pretty good too
Human: Some are worth watching like mob
Human: It's why I just read now tbh <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929> not much time and the anime is long
Human: <@1173229753466101834> agrees
Human: Probably say It's some of the best animation we've gotten in years
Human: REALLY missing out ngl <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
Human: God tier animation
Human: Oh yeah mob psycho too

Human: Is it Poe
Human: no u
Human: He finally admitted to being a cuck
Human: Is it rent a girlfriend
Human: The story is so bad but the arts so good
Human: An eclipse is when your homie takes your girl and fucks them in front of you
Human: Understandable tho
Human: Damn that's bs
Human: When you're a compulsive liar for 14 years you get some experience and have to keep up that lie
Human: What can I say
Human: It's really not that hard to Google a berserk review on a forum or reddit and bullshit your way with knowledge
Human: <a:buffkek:1299900589529894946>

Human: Lemme take a look at my list rq
Human: I think so
Human: Probably in my top 5
Human: Hound of Iron Blood or w/e is really nice too
Human: I was actually upset
Human: Dropped the ball so hard
Human: Taking a break for personal reasons
Human: <:weird:885622768052338708>
Human: So I won't
Human: Like actually garbage
Human: I really want to suggest taking a break but that ending was ass slop
Human: Anything me and blast suggest is good
Human: I've been enjoying it
Human: Infinite Mage is just Eleceed with magic
Human: Not just in manhwa
Human: such a goated series
Human: A lot of manhwa gets really generic but those really surprised me
Human: tbf a lot of stuff isn't like new-new but there's new refreshing takes on shit and the stuff he suggested is
Human: Gross
Human: Because of the new phone? Could've made a backup on tachiyomi and uploaded and if not for future reference
Human: Canon
Human: She's my bitch now
Human: Doesn't exist
Human: I don't remember seeing that
Human: 60 page non ending lets goooo <@524925467216838659>

Human: Who
Human: I don't like gl <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
Human: finally
Human: That could be interesting
Human: What's that
Human: One popular theory is the seller is her package so I kinda wonder if there's anything to it
Human: It's the face and eyes
Human: I mean they are connected so it wasn't surprising
Human: I don't read yuri
Human: Even if I was rich I'd just read all the time tbh
Human: Who
Human: Anime looks like garbage
Human: Got you hyped
Human: Read the ln
Human: I started reading the danmachi ln again and it seems like the ||syr]]|| thing was right <@247446170358644736> <@365995746211921922>
Human: They introduced this guy who can absorb powers right and be threatened to absorb his darkness powers before he died. But then they just do nothing with it and move on
Human: I think frozen player just showed the one thing I really don't like about manhwa or storys in general <@302126021694717973>
Human: It was Zedge
Human: Wallpaper engine is on app store iirc
Human: I remember using an app but it has a ton of ads
Human: Actually I'll get to it eventually
Human: What happened or should I just read it myself
Human: Damn
Human: What one
Human: I hear that a lot
Human: Being naked is expressing yourself without hiding under clothes
And being clothed is living a norm in society 
Unless you're a nudist I guess
Human: Nah
Just sounds like body insecurity
Human: Lol yeah
Human: Femboy Anubis
Human: The Leonidas fight was kinda shit tbh <@187125745531879424>
Human: Pick Me Up and Player Returns are copying each other a lot huh
Human: Think I'm dropping retuned after 10k years the art is actually distinctly garbage now <@302126021694717973>
Human: Pick Me Up has mandatory breaks every now and then and that's awesome

Player who can't level up spoilers
Human: Already reading plenty of those <:dspkek:1175531297540669460>
Human: King Griffin

Human: Everything got so damn rushed in that <:dsppepweird:1174311575021162506>

Spoilers for Player who can't level up
Human: Is that a ~~berserk~~ ygo reference
Human: That was kinda cool
Human: Forgot how good pick me up was
I wonder if the master is ||his sister|| or someone he knows <@302126021694717973>
Human: Ok but he did in the series so I'm not sure where their discussion is going
Human: Chopper ate the human human fruit and he's a hybrid
Human: But then again the devil fruits are all hybrid abilities so probably not
Human: A regular horse fruit would just turn it into a horse but that specific fruit also has hybrid abilities
Human: Oh ok that's why you're asking
Human: What chapter are you on
Human: What about it
Human: Sure
Human: It was like chapter 137 or something
Human: He has wings because he's a bird
Human: Wym by that then. You said if the bird ate the horse horse fruit and it just lets you into a horse
Human: They did
Human: It's a horse hybrid fruit so I guess
Human: Why do I always catch up when there's a cliffhanger
Human: I like the characters that give off actual villainy vibes and act like pirates
Human: But he gets more confident
Human: Not as much as buggy
Human: Somewhat
Human: Even if he's a coward
Human: Feels like an actual pirate
Human: He's an underdog for sure
Human: That is too?
Human: <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
Human: What series is that
Human: Yes
Human: She too crazy
Human: Why did history spoil me in one piece
Human: Wtf spoilers much
Human: It's ||john d. cena||
Human: He discovered teach <@365995746211921922>
Human: I feel bad for Leon <@187125745531879424>
Human: Not enough to be an issue to that extent at least
Human: It doesn't happen often enough to be much of an issue and some of the filler is fine
Human: I wouldn't say it has pacing issues per say but the unnecessary amount of filler can be a bit jarring
Human: It's not exactly a turn off either since they generate a lot of viewers
Human: It gets a lot of its viewers from the anime wym
Human: See: Zom 100 for recent example
Human: Exactly
Human: No
Human: 1 is later on
