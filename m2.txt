McBurn: Comment still stands
McBurn: And nitpicking
McBurn: And hypercritical
McBurn: Ok that was aggressive too
McBurn: I think you just come off as lacking emotional intelligence so you aren't able to receive or take things at times and end up upsetting others due to it. But there's no changing that, and we tolerate you anyway <:Salute:1267690556109226097>

McBurn: I said my peace <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929> tea time
McBurn: If they found it ok to do to you, that doesn't make it ok to do onto others
McBurn: That just seems like victim behaviour
McBurn: That doesn't give you the right to pass it onto others especially when it plays with their insecurities
McBurn: Still kinda fucked you did that to them <:weird:885622768052338708>
McBurn: Don't let it bother you.

McBurn: Him after
McBurn: I'm used to series having shit character progression and interaction so It was nice to see there be something, even if it could be better
McBurn: It was alright
McBurn: I got like 4 bedroom spaces, some downstairs space, and like 2300sq? but the area is kinda....yeah
McBurn: Aight did the math
McBurn: I think rent is like $1300-$1700 standard so I could do like $1000-$1100 but depending on how I do the house I might be able to push for more
Cuz I got a lot of like specific shit put into the house
McBurn: House prices are kinda fucked here so I could get some decent rent out of it
McBurn: pmuch yeah, true true
McBurn: Esp if I'm gonna be in a new place
McBurn: Extra income and stuff
McBurn: Thankfully I got some nice security around the house so It shouldn't? be that bad, but I wouldn't just sell it no
McBurn: It's either I'm close to or it's mostly paid off for the mortage so Instead of selling I'd just rent it out or smth, but maintenance would be a bitch and I'd be afraid of squatters
McBurn: It's alright
McBurn: It's just miserable here
McBurn: It's why I wanna travel before settling down
McBurn: Damn good question my friend
McBurn: It sucks here
McBurn: Thankfully she wants to leave too
McBurn: Sad to say that my gf wont be enough to tie me down cuz I really dont wanna be here
McBurn: I wanna get out of here
McBurn: I've been saving a lot
McBurn: It'll change some dayu
McBurn: I do unfort <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
McBurn: Really nice
McBurn: I would get bored and snack, or do it to feel something, cuz my depression would fuck me or I would keep repeating the same shit and It would get to me

The change has been like
McBurn: Just treating food like fuel rn cuz I was really bad about shit
McBurn: yk
McBurn: One life, make the best of it, don't make shit out of it
McBurn: Food was like an emotional addiction instability so It kept fucking me up
But now I wanna travel more, go out, see the world, and stop mistreating my body
McBurn: Remolding yourself into something better perhaps
McBurn: It's a good mentality
McBurn: Basically semi-fasting which was dumb
McBurn: I made that mistake before and did it again
McBurn: Idk why
McBurn: <:weird:885622768052338708>
McBurn: Basically started myself before
McBurn: I changed my diet and I've been willing to do more shit
McBurn: I'm just going through my backlog so I'll get there some day
McBurn: I just said it's back
McBurn: No <a:WeirdCoffee:458118619130232863>

McBurn: <@524925467216838659>
McBurn: Aight I can recommend it then <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929> I liked the first few chapters a lot
McBurn: Does it have more?
McBurn: Read a few and stopped after it didn't update for like a year or smth
McBurn: Well see about that
McBurn: <@524925467216838659> this guy
McBurn: Your new friend
McBurn: Might also be they're split and the same but idk where it could go tbh
McBurn: Zoe saw the branch crown
McBurn: King of the Tower I guess
McBurn: Maybe? ||Akira foresight|| ability seems like it's engineered since it seems to work as his own cognition and shit so I can see them being part of it

McBurn: It's heavenly delusion all over again
McBurn: I'm sure they'll get their memories and mentality back eventually and maybe we'll learn some weird shit like her having a younger sibling that was 8 inside her that makes her act that young
McBurn: Still ||uwish|| <:dsprock:1174311303515475968>
McBurn: <:dsprock:1174311303515475968>
McBurn: I mean what
McBurn: Yeah I wasn't a fan 
Mostly because I can't sexualize them without coming off as a pdf
McBurn: No story is perfect. As long as they don't rush shit it'll be fine
McBurn: Sorry 
Didn't see right away 

||It's a battle of attrition in the past so they can make a better world.

McBurn: Game I Returned From
McBurn: MIKEY NO
McBurn: This fag doesnt like chuuya as a favorite <@496597770145234944>
McBurn: Is it Chuuya
McBurn: Boo! A Madea Halloween
McBurn: you who
McBurn: ok general
McBurn: based on his irl writer's first wife
McBurn: That's why he said that <:weird:885622768052338708>
McBurn: His ideal woman is probably sasaki anyway
McBurn: ok pdf <:weird:885622768052338708>
McBurn: She's 10
McBurn: No shit <:weird:885622768052338708>

McBurn: Oshit no ko ending tl;dr
McBurn: Time to break the habit
McBurn: Not that's just what you usually do
McBurn: .
McBurn: Exactly
McBurn: His mythos is the outer gods so he can't die conventionally
McBurn: That thing scares me
McBurn: Isn't that you early judging again
McBurn: Mangasee has it
McBurn: I gave one for frieren before that might have the official
McBurn: try changing it
McBurn: might be your source too
McBurn: Can you catch up with the manga and if you like it enough try the anime?
McBurn: The music compliments every scene the pacing is better the expressions complete the characters and moments and the manga doesn't really do as good of a job as it should with actually piecing together the story and the anime is one of the only exceptions where people recommend it over the manga
McBurn: Plenty
McBurn: Sure but you're still reading it and that requires a reasonable amount of attention
McBurn: See this is why I didn't recommend it cuz he'd say no anyway <:dsppepweird:1174311575021162506> <@1043577025459408926>
McBurn: js
McBurn: Also the anime is worth watching
McBurn: The anime treats it like one too
McBurn: It's a special
McBurn: Are you
McBurn: It's all references to writers and famous figures
McBurn: hopefully caught up more by then
McBurn: Open <t:1731713220:R>

McBurn: I'll make a guess and see If I'm right later
McBurn: <:dsppepweird:1174311575021162506>
McBurn: Also I do agree that the anime is worth watching
McBurn: Idk is he?
McBurn: Same
McBurn: Sure <@524925467216838659>
McBurn: Maybe one day
McBurn: Oshi no ko added to worst endings list <@447915149106479104>
McBurn: That angel design is kinda dope
McBurn: I don't think the anime skipped things or changed much and it's got a really nice ost
McBurn: Both are really good actually
McBurn: OPM/Black Clover parody but goes kinda hard ngl
McBurn: The anime not really, the manga has a good amount of chapters
McBurn: Some are really good, western ones not any better tbh
McBurn: I read that before the anime came out tho
McBurn: Mashle pretty good too
McBurn: Some are worth watching like mob
McBurn: It's why I just read now tbh <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929> not much time and the anime is long
McBurn: <@1173229753466101834> agrees
McBurn: Probably say It's some of the best animation we've gotten in years
McBurn: REALLY missing out ngl <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
McBurn: God tier animation
McBurn: Oh yeah mob psycho too
McBurn: madoka magica
McBurn: Actual peak animation
McBurn: Think the best fight for me is still Luffy vs the horny bastard

McBurn: I hate this keyboard
McBurn: gide?
McBurn: Get in the van
McBurn: who
McBurn: Just don't look those up, you'll know it when you see it
McBurn: <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
McBurn: Josh is specific about liking one character type so it's gonna be the boss or one of the hunting dogs
McBurn: time to get a new one
McBurn: nice source
McBurn: Is it Chuuya
McBurn: What chapter did you stop on
McBurn: Is it Poe
McBurn: no u
McBurn: He finally admitted to being a cuck
McBurn: Is it rent a girlfriend
McBurn: The story is so bad but the arts so good
McBurn: An eclipse is when your homie takes your girl and fucks them in front of you
McBurn: Understandable tho
McBurn: Damn that's bs
McBurn: When you're a compulsive liar for 14 years you get some experience and have to keep up that lie
McBurn: What can I say
McBurn: It's really not that hard to Google a berserk review on a forum or reddit and bullshit your way with knowledge
McBurn: <a:buffkek:1299900589529894946>
McBurn: Never thought about that huh
McBurn: Ok sure but what if I just googled reviews on the series and stole them
McBurn: What's that mean
McBurn: <a:RimuruPadoruHyper:642401855913066519>
McBurn: The squad was dead
McBurn: Also that was wrong
McBurn: That was my cousin
McBurn: That first one was a player named guts and the second one seems fake ngl
McBurn: <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
McBurn: No proof though
McBurn: <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
McBurn: Or did i
McBurn: Like how I've bullshit you with knowing about berserk using Google
McBurn: It's a great tool
McBurn: You should use Google more
McBurn: If it makes you feel any better they're NBR
McBurn: It's not meant to be normal
McBurn: She's a brocon
McBurn: .
McBurn: Must be nice
McBurn: Off day?
McBurn: It's noon
McBurn: I said before
McBurn: Based
McBurn: Reading bsd before work
McBurn: So a worse not as comedic trashero
McBurn: Couldn't be any worse than platinum end
McBurn: Gotta go fast
McBurn: Couldn't wait until more chapters so he did it early <:dspkek:1175531297540669460>
McBurn: True
McBurn: Same thing happened to some series I really liked but got rushed and just ruined the experience
McBurn: Yeah it's a shame
McBurn: Might just be deadlined or he can't keep up

McBurn: I think so
McBurn: Probably in my top 5
McBurn: Hound of Iron Blood or w/e is really nice too
McBurn: I was actually upset
McBurn: Dropped the ball so hard
McBurn: Taking a break for personal reasons
McBurn: <:weird:885622768052338708>
McBurn: So I won't
McBurn: Like actually garbage
McBurn: I really want to suggest taking a break but that ending was ass slop
McBurn: Anything me and blast suggest is good
McBurn: I've been enjoying it
McBurn: Infinite Mage is just Eleceed with magic
McBurn: Not just in manhwa
McBurn: such a goated series
McBurn: A lot of manhwa gets really generic but those really surprised me
McBurn: tbf a lot of stuff isn't like new-new but there's new refreshing takes on shit and the stuff he suggested is
McBurn: Gross
McBurn: Because of the new phone? Could've made a backup on tachiyomi and uploaded and if not for future reference
McBurn: Canon
McBurn: She's my bitch now
McBurn: Doesn't exist
McBurn: I don't remember seeing that

McBurn: finally
McBurn: That could be interesting
McBurn: What's that
McBurn: One popular theory is the seller is her package so I kinda wonder if there's anything to it
McBurn: It's the face and eyes
McBurn: I mean they are connected so it wasn't surprising
McBurn: I don't read yuri
McBurn: Even if I was rich I'd just read all the time tbh
McBurn: Who
McBurn: Anime looks like garbage

McBurn: They introduced this guy who can absorb powers right and be threatened to absorb his darkness powers before he died. But then they just do nothing with it and move on
McBurn: I think frozen player just showed the one thing I really don't like about manhwa or storys in general <@302126021694717973>
McBurn: It was Zedge
McBurn: Wallpaper engine is on app store iirc
McBurn: I remember using an app but it has a ton of ads
McBurn: Actually I'll get to it eventually
McBurn: What happened or should I just read it myself
McBurn: Damn
McBurn: What one
McBurn: I hear that a lot
McBurn: Being naked is expressing yourself without hiding under clothes
And being clothed is living a norm in society 
Unless you're a nudist I guess
McBurn: Nah
Just sounds like body insecurity
McBurn: Lol yeah
McBurn: Femboy Anubis
McBurn: The Leonidas fight was kinda shit tbh <@187125745531879424>
McBurn: Pick Me Up and Player Returns are copying each other a lot huh
McBurn: Think I'm dropping retuned after 10k years the art is actually distinctly garbage now <@302126021694717973>
McBurn: Pick Me Up has mandatory breaks every now and then and that's awesome
McBurn: I like when they get enough breaks
McBurn: Says don't hunt in s rank gate after giving him an s rank gate pass <:dsppepweird:1174311575021162506>
McBurn: White Ichigo looking mf
McBurn: ||MMMMIKKEYYYYY||
McBurn: MIKEY WHYYYYY
McBurn: MIKEY NO 
Player who can't level up spoilers
McBurn: Already reading plenty of those <:dspkek:1175531297540669460>
McBurn: King Griffin
McBurn: Ok so now we're bleach
McBurn: Everything got so damn rushed in that <:dsppepweird:1174311575021162506>
McBurn: Gives me I'll be taking a Break for personal reasons vibes and I'm not sure if I like that
Cuz it got rushed at the end 

Spoilers for Player who can't level up
McBurn: Is that a ~~berserk~~ ygo reference
McBurn: That was kinda cool
McBurn: Forgot how good pick me up was
I wonder if the master is ||his sister|| or someone he knows <@302126021694717973>
McBurn: Ok but he did in the series so I'm not sure where their discussion is going
McBurn: Chopper ate the McBurn McBurn fruit and he's a hybrid
McBurn: But then again the devil fruits are all hybrid abilities so probably not
McBurn: A regular horse fruit would just turn it into a horse but that specific fruit also has hybrid abilities
McBurn: Oh ok that's why you're asking
McBurn: What chapter are you on
McBurn: What about it
McBurn: Sure
McBurn: It was like chapter 137 or something
McBurn: He has wings because he's a bird
McBurn: Wym by that then. You said if the bird ate the horse horse fruit and it just lets you into a horse
McBurn: They did
McBurn: It's a horse hybrid fruit so I guess
McBurn: Why do I always catch up when there's a cliffhanger
McBurn: I like the characters that give off actual villainy vibes and act like pirates
McBurn: But he gets more confident
McBurn: Not as much as buggy
McBurn: Somewhat
McBurn: Even if he's a coward
McBurn: Feels like an actual pirate
McBurn: He's an underdog for sure
McBurn: That is too?
McBurn: <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
McBurn: What series is that
McBurn: Yes
McBurn: She too crazy
McBurn: Why did history spoil me in one piece
McBurn: Wtf spoilers much
McBurn: It's ||john d. cena||
McBurn: He discovered teach <@365995746211921922>
McBurn: I feel bad for Leon <@187125745531879424>
McBurn: Not enough to be an issue to that extent at least
McBurn: It doesn't happen often enough to be much of an issue and some of the filler is fine
McBurn: I wouldn't say it has pacing issues per say but the unnecessary amount of filler can be a bit jarring
McBurn: It's not exactly a turn off either since they generate a lot of viewers
McBurn: It gets a lot of its viewers from the anime wym
McBurn: See: Zom 100 for recent example
McBurn: Exactly
McBurn: No
McBurn: 1 is later on
