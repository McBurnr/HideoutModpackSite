The following messages are from McBurn and should be used to inform your understanding of their communication style:
McBurn: Just going to save my own messages to mess with josh later dont mind me
McBurn: If you want a server just for p5x I got one
McBurn: p5x is pretty nice ngl
McBurn: Yes
McBurn: Askeladd was like a second father
McBurn: It's funny how he was so caught off guard by that
McBurn: Rip
McBurn: This one?
McBurn: Would've been cool to see thorfinn go against him when younger tho
McBurn: The same grievance with her i had with our little angry boy ngl
McBurn: Somewhat
McBurn: Which was enough to save her character
McBurn: That's fine and all but a lot of her arc and growth was butchered early on so even accounting for the resemblance it was just tiring to see her any time she showed up and she only had one or two good moments in the later half
McBurn: Can't wait to see the anime onlys complaining about her though
McBurn: She felt unnecessary when introduced, as Thorfinn had already come to regret his past and understand Thors' ideals. Her constant "I'll put an arrow in your back if you slip up" felt redundant since Thorfinn already viewed failing his path as his ultimate failure.
However, in the current arc, she's more compelling. She forgives Thorfinn without fully adopting his philosophy, as shown by her approach to resolving conflict with minimal and deliberate bloodshed.
McBurn: Later on? Probably not
McBurn: But for good reason
McBurn: Quite so
McBurn: And I can see her being the most hated character in the anime once they adapt it
McBurn: Of course my overall opinion is she got a lot better but my complaints with her are my same complaints with Canute. Very slow and poorly done beginning growth but they get a lot better later on
McBurn: The ||Baltic sea war|| was full of her ||constantly throwing the same threats around and it got tiring|| she didn't really show any growth and it took awhile for us to see any and I still share that opinion
McBurn: I can see why
McBurn: Never appeared in the anime yet
McBurn: Easier to do loved more and works better
McBurn: That's about it
McBurn: I was just worried because his clothes had a lot of white in them

McBurn: President <@524925467216838659> has requested the change. You may request certain characters as last minute changes
McBurn: Because he just sent me that
McBurn: He actually would too
McBurn: Just don't be surprised if he dms you in the middle of the night reminding you about how there's tiny Jewish goblins living under your floorboards and wishes you good night
McBurn: He works in DMS too btw

McBurn: Like my brain protecting me from me
McBurn: Honestly forgot the second one existed
McBurn: plap plap
McBurn: Just play as plaptrap
McBurn: We don't talk about the second
McBurn: I enjoyed tales from the borderlands
McBurn: BL3 was painful to finish ngl
McBurn: Less than half tho
McBurn: Imagine buying new games and not finishing old ones
McBurn: <:cg1:1308926055104512082>
McBurn: go to the soup store
McBurn: add more cheese
McBurn: At least here
McBurn: I think
McBurn: Sucks there isn't a complete series blu ray for regular show
McBurn: especially video game preservation <:weird:885622768052338708>
McBurn: I've got a decent amount of old cartoon shows on blu ray and stuff
McBurn: I own it on dvd <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
McBurn: More things for us to add to the watch party

McBurn: Samurai Jack
McBurn: No Courage?
McBurn: Infinity Train was goated

McBurn: <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>

McBurn: If we get married then we're playing Gojira Mea Culpa
McBurn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqhK8OZY7Q0
McBurn: Kami a baddie
McBurn: probably
McBurn: Was it with the bald guy
McBurn: They had a lot of international shows
McBurn: If It was on FX then probably
McBurn: sounds familiar
McBurn: I binge saberspark so I know all the shit cartoons
McBurn: <:discord:1318808590902890526>

McBurn: <:cg1:1308926055104512082>
McBurn: No It's not the one I kept joking about
McBurn: DM me your favorite character <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929> I already have one <@503281674310909992>
McBurn: <:dsddhfangmoment:1278125095776419912>
McBurn: Normal fang behaviour
McBurn: Break deez nuts
McBurn: That's fair
McBurn: Then divorced his real family for the doll family
McBurn: I would call it weird if you tried to interact with them or treat them like your own child or give them names when you're much older than you should be doing that. Like the guy who had an extended doll family when he had an actual family
McBurn: Well hey, if they look nice, then they look nice
McBurn: If they're antiques or something then there's value in them so I don't see the harm. If you actually go out of your way to dress them up or arrange them or something then It's just a hobby. If you interact with them then It's weird. I guess.
McBurn: I mean It depends on what you do with them I guess?
McBurn: Define generic
McBurn: Are you weird for owning the berserk manga?
McBurn: If you like a show, collecting figures or books for it isn't weird.
McBurn: Collecting I guess?
McBurn: But to answer your question, no
McBurn: Thought you called me a pedo or smth
McBurn: That's the only part I read
McBurn: That's *not* what was implied at all <:weird:885622768052338708>
McBurn: That's probably like, the worst assumption you coulda made there ngl <:weird:885622768052338708>
McBurn: You'd be shocked at how many I have <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
McBurn: There's a level to that weirdness
McBurn: Collecting is alright I guess
McBurn: The ones that play with them, sure
McBurn: Some guy was yelling at the cashier some years ago because he didn't get an mlp toy. Seeing it in real life is interesting ngl
McBurn: I have a tech friend that watched it for years and he's an upstanding guy. It just happened to be a pretty good show a lot of guys got into, weird or not. And I've seen the weird ones <:weird:885622768052338708>
McBurn: It's not a bad show
McBurn: At least they're having fun I guess
McBurn: Is it out of the ordinary when there's a lot of people that watch it that are guys? <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929> Actually yeah I guess it is <a:sweat:786574175968034837>
McBurn: It just seemed like you were saying they should spend their time doing something else, but it's their time not yours <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
McBurn: It's their free time <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
McBurn: That's the only reason why I further explained
McBurn: That can be anything though
McBurn: You find it weird, they find it enjoyable. It's not too hard to grasp
McBurn: That's the impression you're giving since you haven't let up on it <:dsphmm:1174311442019790929>
McBurn: That just seems like you're being hyper critical over something you don't personally watch and over a person you don't control over. It's their choice to watch it, it doesn't affect you in anyway, and even if it does that's just a personal disagreement that you're having a mental struggle with.
McBurn: Nah that's fine, It's just a cartoon. Anime are cartoons too. But if you obsess over something then it becomes weird
McBurn: <:weird:885622768052338708>
McBurn: Or talk to kids
McBurn: Roblox is for everyone and there's some really cool games that people have made in it. But if you take it seriously that's really weird
McBurn: damn that song was hard

McBurn: Здесь есть явная отсылка к картине Бэнкси «Ожидание у Уэйна» с долей самореферентной иронии, поскольку тень явно отсылает к прошлому или череде сожалений, которые все еще преследуют эту тему. Тем не менее, в удалении носа в стиле смайликов есть детский оптимизм, давая зрителям понять, что субъект прокладывает свой собственный курс. Именно напряжение между «Днем» (трехмерным человеком) и тенью (на Земле) заставляет зрителей усомниться в их духовности и связи со вселенной. Являемся ли мы трехмерными персонажами или тенями присутствия Бога? Сможем ли мы освободиться от нашего прошлого или нам суждено следовать по пути, с которого мы не сможем сбежать? Это напряжение неизбежно для человечества, и художник уловил сущность «обывателя», а также «потерянной души» и «возвращенной тени». Мы все такие люди, и нам нравится, как рассказываются наши истории.
